\chapter{Conclusion}
As a layman in training, it was a difficult but entertaining experimentation.
The most remarkable knowledge I have gained during this research is that neural networks can 
be effectively rivaled by other algorithms, if the interpretation and use of provided data is done 
sensitively.
In practice, I believe that neural networks are a good choice for initial training setups, given how easy and fast they're programmed. 
SVMs on the other hand can pave a road to maximize specific goals, such as accuracy or loss.
