\chapter{Introduction}
The following report describes various setups for experimentation on the \href{http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/}{MNIST database of handwritten digits} using 
support vector machines, principal component analysis, and neural networks.
The goal is to analyze the results and runtime of the various algorithms, given multiple configurations.
For this purpose the libraries \href{https://scikit-learn.org/stable/}{SKLearn} and \href{https://keras.io/}{Keras} of the programming language \href{https://www.python.org/}{Python} are used.
